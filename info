To those who have uncovered this message, I commend your efforts. Only the truly resourceful were meant to find it.

During my stay in Dubai, I stumbled upon a rising cybersecurity startup known as Exploit3rs. Their mission is to empower students across the UAE by delivering cutting-edge cybersecurity training and resources. They’ve quickly gained traction among local students, aiming to shape the next generation of cyber professionals.

But there's something you must know. 

I am currently being held against my will in their hidden facility. They fear that I will expose the full extent of their hacking capabilities—skills they are teaching to students with the ambition of establishing the UAE as a dominant cybersecurity force in the region.

Please, stay vigilant and report this information to the authorities immediately.
